Description:

My portfolio website is a comprehensive showcase of my work and skills, consisting of four distinct pages: 
Home, Projects, Skills, and Contact. 

CSS Grid Layout in Skills Page:
The Skills page utilizes CSS Grid layout to elegantly present my skills and expertise. 
This provides a structured and visually appealing presentation of my capabilities.

6. Mixins: Mixins are employed to encapsulate and reuse sets of CSS declarations, promoting consistency and efficiency.
7. Functions: Custom functions are introduced to perform specific operations within the stylesheet.
